# Getting Started 🚀

Orchestrator coordinates AI coding workflows from a terminal console. It turns feature requests and bug reports into tracked jobs that move through planning, verification, test-driven implementation, and review. Swift has the deepest support; Rust, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Go support is in beta.

## Set Up a Project ⚙️

From the project root, run:

```bash
orchestrator wizard
orchestrator check
orchestrator console
```

The wizard detects the project stack, creates `.orchestrator/project.json` and missing starter docs, and configures at least one AI model. GitHub, remote machines, and Apple delivery are optional. `orchestrator check` validates prerequisites and AI provider access; `orchestrator console` opens the interactive console.

## Run Your First Job 🧠

In the console:

1. Select **New Job**.
2. Choose a feature, iteration, bug fix, or design workflow.
3. Describe the work in plain language.
4. Choose a branch and whether to continue automatically after planning.
5. Follow progress from the job history.

Feature jobs use a test-driven workflow: plan the tests, verify the plan, write a failing test, implement the change, and review the result.
